  // Note: A secret key is required on the server side.
  //       A secret key can be created and stored in the environment variable
  //       because it's safer than storing it in the project.
  //       To do this, open the command window as an administrator and type the command
  //       setx SECRET "SecretKeyHere" /M
  //       This creates a system environment variable with the name SECRET and the value SecretKeyHere.
  //       By using /M, we specify that we want a system variable and not local.
  //       Restart the project after creating the secret for it to work.
